A collection for small scripts I wrote purely for fun! This repo is their collective home because I am often conflicted if i should push a small program because it's small & I don't like pointless repos but also my storage space is sad and I hoard everything (in the virtual space)! 

| Folder | Description |
|--|--|
| glorified_fizz_buzz | I wanted to practice connecting python + html & css to Flask and this was the end product ( a simple visualization of the oh so complicated de facto intro CS problem that is Fizz Buzz)|
| not_cheating_at_wordscape |I had a short [Wordscape](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wordscapes/id1207472156) phase and this is a Flask application where the suer can change the url (endpoint) to be a collection of letters and all the possible anagrams of that word are displayed / Basically, I got stuck and don't like cheating and this was the result.  |
| wordle| I love playing [Wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/) so this is a quick spinoff in Python meant to be played in the terminal so I can play more than once a day!|
| discREEEEte | A small collection of random scripts I wrote to check my homework in Math 55/Discrete @ HMC reeee this class was hard for me lol |
